This project utilizes multiple API requests (GeoApify and OpenWeatherApp) to autocomplete user input and allow user to search for weather data in a specific location.
I made this project using ReactJS and TailwindCSS to incorporate the fundamentals of React: useStates, useEffects, and props, while also handling multiple fetch requests.
I wanted to have an autocomplete feature that suggests the location based on the user input, which is why I chose GeoApify's location API which filters locations and returns their coordinates, which is then used in OpenWeatherApp to get weather data.
